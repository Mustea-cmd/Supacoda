# Replit/Config Migration

This project was originally set up for Replit, which used `replit.md` and `.replit` for configuration and instructions. All configuration is now managed in `.config` for consistency across all platforms.

**If you are using Replit:**
- The main entry point is `npm run dev`.
- The project uses Node.js 20, PostgreSQL 16, and a web server.
- Environment variables and workflow are set in `.config`.
- To start the app, use the Run button or run `npm run dev` in the shell.
- For deployment, use the build and run commands in `.config`.

**For all other platforms:**



# Extension System & Remote Registry

Supacoda features a professional, extensible extension system supporting language, ML, and NLP extensions. Extensions are auto-discovered and loaded at startup, and the IDE can fetch new or updated extensions from a remote registry.

- **Remote Extension Registry:**
  - On startup, Supacoda fetches available extensions from a remote registry (`client/src/extensions/remoteRegistry.ts`).
  - New extensions are auto-installed and activated if not already present locally.
  - The system falls back to local simulated extensions if the remote registry is unavailable.
  - Extensions can be updated or added dynamically without redeploying the IDE.
- **How to Add Extensions:**
  - Add new language or tool modules to `client/src/extensions/languages/` or similar folders.
  - Register them in `client/src/extensions/index.ts` for local use.
  - For remote/distributed updates, publish to the remote registry endpoint.

- **Self-Updating:**
  - The extension system checks for new/updated extensions on every startup.
  - No manual update required for usersâ€”extensions are always up to date.

## Extension Management UI

Supacoda now includes a professional Extension Manager UI, accessible from the main menu bar ("Extensions").

- View all installed extensions (local and remote)
- Enable/disable extensions on demand
- Roadmap: update, uninstall, health/status, version info, remote registry browsing, one-click install, details, changelogs, and permissions

This UI provides a seamless, VS Code-like experience for managing your IDE's capabilities, and will continue to evolve with more advanced features.
