# Migration Notice
#
# This project previously used `replit.md` and `.replit` for configuration and instructions.
# All configuration and workflow is now managed in this `.config` file for consistency.
#
# If you are migrating from Replit, refer to the `readme.md` for migration instructions.
# Do not use `replit.md` or `.replit` for configurationâ€”this file is canonical.
